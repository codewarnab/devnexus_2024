# Botify

This project is built upon the **[NextAdmin](https://demo.nextadmin.co/)** template. We have used this as our base UI framework, customizing and extending it with additional components and features.

## Project Overview

This project leverages the **NextAdmin** template from **[Next.js Templates](https://nextjstemplates.com/templates/nextadmin)** as the primary foundation of our user interface. We selected this template because of its robust design system, responsive components, and the seamless integration it offers with Next.js. It allowed us to quickly set up a scalable and maintainable frontend for our application.

### Template: **NextAdmin**

- **Source**: [Next.js Templates - NextAdmin](https://nextjstemplates.com/templates/nextadmin)
- **Demo**: [NextAdmin Demo](https://demo.nextadmin.co/)

The **NextAdmin** template provided a clean, highly customizable design that was crucial for building the frontend of our application. It became the backbone of our UI, which we modified and enhanced to suit our project's specific needs.

## Additional Tools and Features

Alongside the **NextAdmin** template, we also leveraged generative UI tools and AI-based solutions for efficiently building out UI components and solving bugs during development:

- **[v0.dev/chat](https://v0.dev/chat)**: Used for generating various UI components.
- **[Claude.ai](https://claude.ai/)**: Assisted in debugging and resolving UI-related issues with generative suggestions.

These tools allowed us to accelerate the development process, especially for complex or repetitive UI components, while maintaining consistency with the design system established by **NextAdmin**.
